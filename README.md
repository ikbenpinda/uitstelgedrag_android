# uitstelgedrag_android
Uitstelgedrag app for Android devices.

This app is mostly a proof-of-concept that hopefully will end up being something entirely usable.  

This project uses the following libraries:

- ButterKnife
- SmartLocation
- RetroLambda
- Google Services
- MaterialDrawer

To make this work you need to add a google-services.json file.
You can generate one using the google dev console or copy one if you have an existing one.
