# Uitstelgedrag_android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ikbenpinda/uitstelgedrag_android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ikbenpinda/uitstelgedrag_android) 

### Procrastination for Android.

_Uitstelgedrag is a to-do list app with emphasis on UX and underlying technique._

Uitstelgedrag is a to-do app and proof-of-concept.  
Yes, i know. But this time it’s focused making superuser stuff supereasy, as well as filtering information so it only shows what is really relevant.   
So no nested lists, and adding additional info made as easy as possible.  

### FEATURES(screenshots!)

    scr

###### Context awareness

This app uses your location to filter out irrelevant tasks. Added locations and labels are remembered and suggested so you can quickly add existing labels to your items.  

    scr

###### Day/Night Theme

To make things easier on your eyes it automatically switches between day/night themes based on the current light level or time of day. No more all-white flashlight in your face when you open the app at night! Unless you like it that way of course, it’s all adjustable from the settings.

###### Superuser mode

Using the app regularly? Just switch to superuser mode from the settings and quickly add items and label them in one go by using the “#”, “,” and “@” characters.  

    scr

###### Widget

Quickly check items or add new ones without even opening the app!  

    scr

###### Notifications

Off by default to not overwhelm you with it all at once, these can be used to show your tasks from the notification bar so you don’t even have to unlock your phone. Just because i like you that much. :’)  

    scr

###### Additional notes

Want to quickly add some notes? No need to switch between apps, just add some notes straight from the app. Photos and recordings don’t even require additional actions - just reorientate your device and it’ll pick up from there. (landscape for pictures, face-down or to your body for recordings)  

## installation guide

Add your own keys for the Google Services API and the Facebook SDK*, and you’re good to go. For the Google Services key you can use the [Dev Console](https://console.developers.google.com/?pli=1).  

*(The Facebook SDK isn’t currently used, and might not be in the later versions, but for now it is required or the app will fail to start.)  

### Why another to-do app? Aren’t there already >9000 apps for this?

As a rather forgetful person, i like to set reminders. However, regardless of which way i noted them down, in the end i always got discouraged by the extensive list of stuff that needed to be done, as well as not being able to prioritize them well because of it.  

So i try to label things nicely, set deadlines, add reminders to your tasks - and all i end up with is more time spent adding stuff that needs to be done and a list of even more lists.  

This is an attempt at fixing that, and learning new cool stuff on my way there.  

Hopefully, this will end up as a great way of filtering your stuff, as well as showing how things like how to do:  
reactive programming  
dependency injection  
model-view-presenter architecture  
hardware use  
SQLite easier  

So basically, to learn new stuff and hopefully pass on that knowledge, while solving a recurring problem as well.
