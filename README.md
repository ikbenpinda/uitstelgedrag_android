# uitstelgedrag_android
Uitstelgedrag app for Android devices.

This app is mostly a proof-of-concept that hopefully will end up being something entirely usable.  

This project uses the following libraries:

- ButterKnife
- SmartLocation
- RetroLambda
- Google Services
- MaterialDrawer
- Facebook SDK
- Glide

To make this work you need to add a google-services and Facebook SDK key.
You can generate one using the google dev console or copy one if you have an existing one.

### SPEC

    - manage your todo list
    - manage notes
